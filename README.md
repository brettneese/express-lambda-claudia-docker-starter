# express-lambda-claudia-docker-starter

This provides a starter repo to build and deploy Lambda-based services using Nodejs (Express), Docker, and Claudia to manage consistency across development and run environments. You can build services with native dependencies, run them on your machine using a local server, and deploy them while all wrapped up in the same Docker image AWS uses to run Lambda.
